                Hi, my name is Raisa. I am currently a third year software engineering student at the University of Calgary.
                My interest in programming began in high school. I took computer science classes all throughout high school 
                and was intrigued by how vast the field was. I was also a part of my high school's robotics team in which I was 
                the Women in STEM team lead. My main role was to organize events and encourage young women to pursue a STEM career.
                Although I was not directly involved in the programming of the robots, I was very interested in it, which eventually 
                led me to pursue software engineering in university.
                <br>
                <br>
                In my second year of university, my high school interest in robotics led me to join the Schulich Space Rover Team in which 
                I was involved in for about 8 months. Over these 8 months, I did some smaller projects, but the main feature I contributed 
                to is the camera feed. I worked alongside other students to stream real-time camera footage from the rover to devices 
                so that we could see what the rover sees.
                <br>
                <br>
                Throughout the rest of my post seconday journey I have worked on many class projects in which I learned many valuable 
                technical skills from full stack web development to working with databases and even several projects in our embedded systems
                class. Please see more details in the "Projects" page.
